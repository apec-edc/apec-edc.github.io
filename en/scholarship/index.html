    <p>Originating from Taiwan’s Chin Shin oolong tea, Ruan Zhi oolong tea No. 17 has been highly popular in Thailand. The objective of this research is to investigate the volatile aromatic and phenolic compounds of Ruan Zhi oolong tea No. 17 cultivated in different altitudes of Chiang Rai, Thailand, by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, respectively. Ultimately, the research results can be used to advance the technology of tea production in Thailand and Taiwan.</p>

    <p>As the economic, social and diplomatic ties between Canada and Taiwan are strengthening, acculturation studies can be an important foundation to achieve mutual understanding between two cultures and policy design. This study focuses on the role of communication and applies the concept of timing and spatiality to examine how Canadian workers in Taiwan acculturate to a new culture through everyday interactions with their Taiwanese colleagues.</p>

    <p>Assam tea is rich in antioxidant activity due to a greater polyphenolic content, such as flavonols. The study aims to investigate teaghrelin-like compounds in different aged and cultivated area in wild forests in northern Thailand, and to compare the amount of teaghrelin-like compounds contained in Chin Shin oolong tea, by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).</p>

    <p class="mb-4">In earthquake-prone countries such as Indonesia and Taiwan, it is necessary to apply the liquefaction mitigation techniques in liquefaction prone areas. The principle of liquefaction mitigation is increasing the shear strength of sand layers, and using vetiver grass to increase the shear strength is a potential biotechnical method. The study will be tested on the centrifuge model and shaking table, in order to investigate the effect of vetiver root on the change of pore water pressure and ground settlement during the earthquake.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Given the growing inter-dependence between economies of ASEAN-5 countries, including Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, the study proposes to develop a hypothetical currency unit, called ASEAN Exchange Rates Unit (AERU), for these five countries to achieve the stability of currency and exchange rates in this region under normal and crisis periods. The study then provides concrete steps to be taken to ensure an optimum currency union.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Recent studies have shown that Pu’er tea is abundant in strictinin, and the content of strictinin in wild trees is significantly higher than that in cultivated shrubs. The objective of this research is to evaluate the antibacterial activities of strictinin as well as its laxative activity of enhancing gastrointestinal motility in an animal model by analyzing samples of Pu’er tea grown in Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai provinces in Thailand.</p>

    <div class="pt-4 border-t border-dotted border-teal-500"><span class="underline">Sarunpron Khruengsai</span> (Thailand)</div>
    <p class="mb-4">This study examines the compounds of oolong tea grown in Thailand, including Taicha No.12, hybrids No. 17, No. 19 and No. 21, especially its teaghrelin-like compounds.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Having stayed in Europe for a century and a half, the Kalmyks contributed greatly to strengthening the Russian state. The research aims to create a systematized database that stores archival documents of the XVII-XVIII centuries concerning the history of the Kalmyks. Since a sufficient number of related documents moved after 1949 to Taiwan, it is hoped that these documents can be explored here to further understand the Kalmyks.</p>

    <p><span class="italic">Buxu ci</span>, or “Lyrics for Pacing the Void,” plays an important role in Daoist rituals, and also has a tremendous impact on the Chinese poetic tradition. In Tang dynasty, <span class="italic">Buxu</span> hymns became a fixed part in the Daoist rituals. By examining the versions of hymns from Tang, Song, and Ming dynasties, the research aims to understand the nature of Daoist rituals, the use of revealed scripture in Daoist rituals, and the relationship between Daoist music, poetry, meditation, and dance. In addition, as Taiwan is rich in Daoist tradition, as well as experts in the study of Daoism of various periods, this research also aims to clarify the contemporary ritual performance of these hymns and related ritual practices in Taiwan.</p>
