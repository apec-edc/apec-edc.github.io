    <p class="mb-4">Originating from Taiwan’s Chin Shin oolong tea, Ruan Zhi oolong tea No. 17 has been highly popular in Thailand. The objective of this research is to investigate the volatile aromatic and phenolic compounds of Ruan Zhi oolong tea No. 17 cultivated in different altitudes of Chiang Rai, Thailand, by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, respectively. Ultimately, the research results can be used to advance the technology of tea production in Thailand and Taiwan.</p>
