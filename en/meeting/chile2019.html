    <li class="mb-4">Chinese Taipei Associate Researcher Wang Sheng-Min of Taiwan Institute of Economic Research gave an update on the progress of 'Advancing Career Development of Athletes in the APEC Region'. The project includes opinions of the government, industry, and academia in the discussion of the career development for athletes. So far, two workshops were held in 2018, attracting 29 delegates from APEC economies and more than 180 national and foreign participants. Three e-newspapers, titled 'Digital Economy X Esports', 'Digital Age X Athletes Career Development', and 'Mega Games X Sports Professionals' have been published in 2,000 copies that are widely received. In 2019, two more workshops are scheduled to take place in Malaysia and Taipei in June and November respectively.</li>

    <li class="mb-4">Chinese Taipei Professor Michael Tanangkingsing of National Taipei University of Technology gave a briefing on 'Regional Industry-Academia Collaboration for Talent Development and Inclusive Growth: An Exchange of Skills Training, Internship and Jobs (II)'. He explained the projects currently underway, implementation results in the past three years, and events scheduled in 2019. The presentation focused on how vocational schools in Taiwan establish an industry-academia collaborative relationship with corporates, as well as the efforts dedicated to reducing the discrepancy between what's taught in schools and what's required in the job market. The project has received APEC funding and will host a workshop in Taipei in September.</li>

    <li class="mb-4">Chinese Taipei Professor Eric Lin of National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) gave a briefing on 'APEC Forum on Digital Innovation and Entrepreneurship'. He shared results Taiwan has attained in innovative and entrepreneurial education in the 21st century. A three-day workshop was held in October 2018 at NTUT, offering entrepreneurial skills training to innovative and creative young people.  In addition, Professor Lin proposed a new project for 2020 which will focus on digital entrepreneurship, female entrepreneur cultivation, and examples of entrepreneurship projects launched by the government. The United States and Indonesia expressed their support for the new project, and Indonesia was willing to co-sponsor it. After the briefing, the coordinator congratulated Chinese Taipei on the two projects that have received phase-one APEC fundings this year. She also suggested the word 'Education' be included in project titles to highlight the theme.</li>

    <li class="mb-4">Chinese Taipei Professor Chiu Mei-Hung of National Taiwan Normal University delivered a report on a new project, ‘Cross-Border Human Capacity Building for Glocalized Scientific Literacy: Phase 1&2_Longitudinal Exchange and Community Formation of STEM+ Education for School Girls, Women, and Teacher Professional Development’. The project encompasses two phases. Phase one focuses on enhancing the teaching competency of STEM-related instructors so that the teaching caters to modern technological development. Phase two stresses on enhancing students' learning motive on science, math and technology, particularly that of female students. Phase two of the project has received APEC funding, and a workshop will take place this year.</li>

  <p class="mb-4">In the EDNET Meeting, we maintain good ties with South Korea, the United States, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, and other economies as we share our best practices in education. This year, the Ministry of Education has proposed two projects, ‘APEC Workshop on Regional Industry-Academia Collaboration for Talent Development’ and ‘APEC STEM Plus Glocalization Workshop’, which were the only two projects in the EGNET working group that have received phase-one funding approved by the APEC Secretariat.
