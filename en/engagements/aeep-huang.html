  <p class="text-sm italic mb-4">Reflection from Huang Shao-Min, Department of Political Science, National Chung Cheng University</p>

  <p class="mb-4">When applying for the exchange program, I was in Vietnam visiting my family. But as I noticed the annual theme of the program – Social Enterprises as Promoter for Economic Empowerment and Participation of Women in APEC Region – and its overview, I believed I could truly make use of the experience and knowledge gained over the past years. I am deeply grateful for this opportunity given by the Ministry of Education.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">According to my personal experience in Vietnam, married women often stay at home to take care of their children and household chores, and husbands/fathers support the family financially. The unfortunate reality is if women are mistreated (e.g. experiencing domestic violence), they are usually unable to escape from the terrible situation because of financial issues. Even though they wish to reenter the workforce, they tend to be confined by traditional concepts. Faced with these social problems, Mrs. Hong created a social enterprise called Coins for Change, which aims to empower women with skills to achieve financial independence and to provide educational support for their children by working with international volunteers.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">An enterprise competition I once participated in focused on a UN goal of sustainable development and the idea was to find eco-friendly ways to help the ocean. We tried to enhance the operation of packaging-free supermarkets and to promote reusing systems of reusable cups. Developing social enterprises has a positive effect on the society, and 2019 AEEP in South Korea has tried to invite more young people to engage in the very idea.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">During AEEP, young participants came from Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, China, etc. When the participants worked together in brainstorming for global social problems, both insights and conflicts arose. In Group 1 that I belonged to, a participant from Korea held contradictory views about childcare welfare policy and organizations against me. In Korea, when a woman is married or pregnant, she is probably considered out of the workforce and expected to dedicate her youthful life to taking care of the family and children. However, in our economy, Chinese Taipei, the provision of childcare provider services and childcare centers as well as childcare welfare policies are rather comprehensive. In Korea, women experience a sense of insecurity due to social norms and the news reports about children being abused when taken care by other people. Therefore, as representatives of different economies, we could not help but look at the same topic based on our own social context.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">We finally reached a conclusion of setting up kindergartens in companies. Our target is small companies rather the big ones because the big ones are required by law to operate kindergartens to help their employees take care of their children. However, our idea of the social enterprise is to provide ways of gaining resources for smaller companies to start kindergartens so that their employees (especially women) are able to stay in the workplace.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Besides the in-depth exploration of social issues during the program, personal interactions between the ambitious young participants from different countries are also inspiring. We talked about career paths, life goals, etc., hoping such experiences would help us walk firmly on our own life’s path. Through communications, we are able to get nutrients for life and to learn from others’ advantages in order to become a competent contributor not only to our society but to the whole world.</p>
