  <p class="mb-4">APEC Workshop on Regional Industry-Academia Collaboration for Talent Development focuses on human resources development and regional economic growth. The long-term goal is to assist with youth employment by cultivating talents that match the demands of the labor market through industry-academia collaboration and competency training. Vocational education in Taiwan has long been corporate-demand-oriented, where students pick up professional skills and knowledge through industry-academia collaboration and internships while in school. The hands-on practices allow them to be in sync with market trends and further prepare themselves for future employment. Trained to cater to market demands, students graduating with a diploma, knowledge and job competency will become technical talents with practical professional skills.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Echoing the theme of 2018, the government’s New Southbound Industry-Academia Collaboration International Program is at the core of the 2019 APEC Workshop on Regional Industry-Academia Collaboration for Talent Development. The workshop focuses on promoting cross-country industry-academia collaboration, reducing the discrepancy between cultures and professional skills, and fostering students to become cross-cultural professionals.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Female participants of the program were invited to share their experiences. Guests from corporates and labor units also provided insights into future trends and the dedicated resources respectively. The workshop set out to encourage more female participation in the economic sector, which will reduce the gender gap and facilitate economic growth.</p>
