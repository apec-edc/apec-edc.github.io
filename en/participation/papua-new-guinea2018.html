  <h2 class="mb-4 text-xl">The content of the 35th EDNET conference</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">The HRDWG consists of three networks, one of them being the Education Network (EDNET). Its main task is to implement educational exchange activities within APEC. The aim of APEC educational activities is the establishment of a strong and vigor learning system within an Economy and to strengthen the function of education in fostering a social, individual, and economic sustainable development. Although there exist differences among the education systems of the respective member economies, during the last years, the Education Network facilitated with great efforts mutual experience sharing and learning. </p>

  <p class="mb-4">In order to directly participate in the planning and proposing process of APEC human resource and education related matters, and to share the most exemplary cases of Taiwan’s education with the APEC members, Taiwan was represented by the Department Head of the Department of International and Cross-Strait Education Andi Bi 畢祖安 and Vice Counselor Chen Baoling 陳寶鈴. Ming Chuan University’s Vice President for International Affairs Liu Kuo-Wei 劉國偉, National Taiwan Normal University Professor Chiu Mei-Hung 邱美虹, National Taipei University of Technology Associate Professor Eric Lin 林彥良 and his assistant Miss Xie Bingyan 謝秉諺 did also attend the meeting. They put forward new projects to enhance the cooperation in the education sector between the member economies and shared the progress and results of accomplished activities.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Chair woman Wang Yan 王燕 proposed the plan to establish an APEC-EDNET website. She expressed her expectations for the EDNET website-project to contain the APEC-EDNET projects of all member economies, the latest progress and reforms of the member’s education sectors, educational basic information, basic education, higher education, vocational education, scientific and technological education, and other educational relevant matters At the same time, it should reflect education relevant matters and reports. The first step of the project is the creation of a database that contains important education-related documents and publications of APEC-EDNET. Beside, the information provided by the website shall make it more convenient for member economies to include educational related people and matters that are worth sharing into special column reports. The representative of the USA proposed that the website of the APEC Secretariat was suitable for an immediate update, and that all detailed documents of the project should be uploaded onto this website. If there was an independent APEC-EDNET website, even more detailed documents could be uploaded. Chairwomen Wang Yan also mentioned that the APEC Newsletter: APEC Education Development has already officially been published. If the content of the newsletter was also available on the website, even more educationalists could easier have access to information regarding project contents, the newest education strategies, and programs of action.</p>
