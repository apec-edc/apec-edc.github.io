  <h1 class="text-2xl py-4 text-teal-600">APEC Edutainment Exchange Program (AEEP)</h1>
  <p class="mb-4">Ever since its beginning in 2007, more than 2,000 participants from Asia-Pacific region have joined the AEEP and enjoyed blended learning opportunities conjoining school curriculum with experiential hands-on learning activities.</p>

  <p class="mb-4">Themes are chosen annually, which are based on annual APEC theme and priority areas. First, AEEP participants are oriented about APEC and share its mission, roles and functions and further develop self-initiated projects and present on their chosen subject.

  <p class="mb-4">The purpose of AEEP is to nurture future APEC leaders with such capabilities as creativity and cooperation, providing future educational model in which participants are encouraged to define a problem and find a solution to it by utilizing various decision-making & problem-solving tools.

  <p class="mb-4">Through on- and off-line activities, the students would be able to cultivate global leadership, communication skills and knowledge required for development of APEC in the 21st century.

  <p class="mb-4">As of 2018, under the theme of “Social Enterprise as key problem solver for inclusive and sustainable growth in APEC region”, participants are encouraged to be interested in social problems around them and can <em class="font-bold italic">have the opportunity to develop a social business plan</em> by cooperating with others in the attempt to seek for a solution to a social problem they choose. (<em class="italic">Design Thinking Process</em>)

  <p class="mb-4">Participants can <em class="font-bold italic">learn the concept of Social Economy</em> and understand the difference between conventional enterprises – and their activities for societal contribution (e.g. Corporate Social Responsibility) – and social cooperatives through real cases.</p>
