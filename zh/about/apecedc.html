  <p>The APEC Education Development Center proposed in this project will serve as a platform dedicate to cross regional education cooperation, high quality education reform and global talent cultivation. By conducting research, encouraging cross-regional exchange and cooperation, setting up a bilingual website for the sharing and dissemination of information and hosting capacity building workshops and conferences to address issues such as regional talent development, digital knowledge enhancement, STEM education, technological and vocational education and skills training, female empowerment and innovative entrepreneurship cultivation in the digital age, this project will be in line with both APEC priorities in 2015 (“Investing in Human Capital Development”) and 2016 (“Developing Human Capital”) as well as the initiative proposed by the host economy, Vietnam, in 2017 (“APEC Framework on Human Resources Development in the Digital Age”) and the 2017 APEC Education Strategy proposed by the HRDWG-EDNET. Furthermore, it also responds to the 2019 APEC priorities of “Digital Society” and “Women, SMEs, and Inclusive Growth” with its emphasis on digital competency enhancement, educational adjustability in the emerging digital age, female engagement in non-traditional sector, and so forth. With the continuous research, productive discussion and best practices sharing on high quality education reform and human capital cultivation, this project will not only contribute to the inclusive growth but also the economic prosperity within the APEC region.</p>
